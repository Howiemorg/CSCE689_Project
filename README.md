To run this application is very simple.

Upon downloading the code, you must go into the frontend and backend folder in separate terminals and run npm install to get
all the required modules.

After completing that, you must do npm run start in the backend terminal first. This ensures that the backend and database are setup 
before the frontend tries to pull from it.

Finally, run "npm run start" in the frontend terminal and the application will pop up in your browser for use.

All passwords are encrypted and hashed so do not worry about any security concerns. However, I do recommend not using one of your
commonly used passwords anyways.
